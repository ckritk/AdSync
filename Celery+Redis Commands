Celery + Redis Setup & Commands

1. Install Requirements
For macOS/Linux:
  pip3 install celery redis
  If you face zsh: no matches found: celery[redis], use this without square brackets.
  pip install 'celery[redis]' 'celery[beat]'

2. Start Redis Server
For macOS (with Homebrew):
  brew install redis
  brew services start redis
Windows:
  Download Redis from: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases
  Run redis-server.exe from extracted folder

3. Start Celery Worker
  celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
  celery_app is the name of your file (celery_app.py).
